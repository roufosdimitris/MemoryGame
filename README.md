# MemoryGame

Hello, this is a simple but a little different version of the classic game that was created for an assignment at university.
It is solely text-based and the number of card pairs is given as a **command line argument** (e.g. java MemoryGame 5).
It doesn't have many features but maybe someday I will make it a little better.
Feel free to use whatever you need from the code.
